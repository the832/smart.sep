# üöÄ Project Overview

The Smart Plastic Separation Car integrates multiple technologies to create an autonomous and intelligent waste management system. At its core, it uses an ESP32-CAM module paired with advanced machine learning algorithms to detect and classify plastics into dry and wet categories with high accuracy. The system is equipped with a 6-DOF (Degrees of Freedom) robotic arm controlled via servo motors that physically sorts plastics based on the AI classification.

Environmental sensors such as soil moisture, temperature, and ultrasonic sensors monitor the surrounding conditions and garbage bin status, enabling adaptive responses and real-time alerts. This data is streamed through IoT protocols to a web dashboard, allowing users to monitor system performance remotely.

The system‚Äôs vehicle base is designed for autonomous navigation within controlled environments, improving the reach and efficiency of plastic collection. The combination of sensor feedback, AI vision, and robotic control provides a scalable and sustainable approach to plastic waste management.
